## Validation Papers
- **Papa et al. (2016)** — 584 patients. GFAP performed consistently in detecting MMTBI, CT lesions, and neurosurgical intervention across 7 days. UCH-L1 performed best in the early postinjury period. [PDF](/files/mtbi/Papa-2016.pdf) (*JAMA Neurology*)
- **Yue et al. (2019)** — 450 patients. Measuring blood GFAP with a point-of-care test within 24 hours of injury can help detect TBI and flag patients who need imaging or follow-up. [PDF](/files/mtbi/Yue-2019.pdf) (*Lancet Neurology*)
- **Bazarian et al. (2021)** — 1936 patients. In over 1,900 patients with mild TBI, the biomarker showed very high sensitivity (~96%) and negative predictive value (>99%) for detecting CT-positive brain injuries. [PDF](/files/mtbi/Bazarian-2021.pdf) (*Academic Emergency Medicine*)
- **Menditto et al. (2024)** — 234 patients, mean age 81 years old. Patients were included even if taking a DOAC or warfarin. GFAP had a 100% negative predictive value. [PDF](/files/mtbi/Menditto-2024.pdf) (*Clin Chem Lab Med*)
- **Welch et al. (2025)** — 1899 patients, age 18-98 years old with head injury and GCS 9-15 in ED. Sensitivity 96.7%, negative predictive value 99.4%. [PDF](/files/mtbi/Welch-2025.pdf) (*American Journal of Emergency Medicine*)
